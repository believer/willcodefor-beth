# willcodefor

Inspired by [@ethanniser](https://github.com/ethanniser)'s [video on the BETH Stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpzowDDJj24) running on the bleeding edge stack of:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/)
- [Turso](https://turso.tech/)
- [htmx](https://htmx.org/)

I'm doing, yet another, rewrite of my personal website. I'll probably write a post about it later on.

## Previous iterations

- Using [Remix](https://github.com/believer/willcodefor-remix)
